            <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

            <h2>Twice Baked Potato</h2>
            <span>Origin: South American</span>
            <span>Source: <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24332/ultimate-twice-baked-potatoes/">Recipe Source Link</a></span>
            <span>Category: Main Dish, Comfort Food</span>
        
            <img src="images/Bakedpotato.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Twice Baked Potato">
            <p>These twice-baked potatoes work perfectly as a simple, crowd-pleasing entrée or as a rich side dish. It is believed that baked potatoes originate from South America, or more specifically, Peru. The Inca Indians in Peru were said to be the first to originally cultivate potatoes and when the Spanish conquistadors conquered Peru, they brought the potato to Europe.</p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large baking potatoes</li>
                <li>8 slices bacon</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>½ cup milk</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
                <li>8 green onions, sliced, divided</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
            <ol>
                <li>Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour, depending on the size of your potatoes. Set potatoes aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Slice potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop the flesh into a large bowl; save skins.</li>
                <li>Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions to the potato; mix with a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.</li>
                <li>Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.</li>
                <li>Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Serve Hot!</li>

            <p>White sauce pasta is a creamy and savory dish that can be enjoyed for either lunch or dinner. Inspired by a fusion of Italian and French cuisine, the rough texture of rigatoni pasta allows for heavier sauces to be picked up, including the flavor profile of this delicious sauce. This union of two cultures allows for the perfect balance between each component of the recipe, creating a fulfilling entree that every individual can enjoy.</p>
            <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Once the water begins to bubble, add in the pasta, salt, and a drizzle of oil.</li>

            <p>This recipe is a fantastic way to step up your pasta game without taking too much more of your time. It tastes way better than basic pasta with jarred sauce! I originally found this when my sister made it, and got the recipe off of Bon Appetit's website. PS avoid using the shaker parmesan - I used that the first time I made this and it drew down the quality of the dish.</p>
