       <P>My cat Appa, is an Ethiopian cat. And like many Ethiopian cats she was allowed to leave the house and explore the neighborhood. Although she spent most of the time home, She would go out to explore and come back for food or dusk.</P>
       <p>She was a very smart/ manipulative cat. Like many cats she didn't like being touched unless she wanted it. She would avoid people she disliked but if she is hungry she will make you feel like she loves you even if you're her enemy.</p>
